Matiane is a **lightweight reimplementation** of Gitâ€™s core commands. Methods are implemented (with additional header files) under `utils/` folder, while `main.cpp` controls the flow.

## Compilation

Compile with `g++` (requires **zlib**):

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 src/main.cpp -lz -o matiane
```

## Supported commands

General template: ```./matiane <command> [options]```

### `init`

The `init` command is used to initialize an empty Matiane repository. It sets up the required directory structure, creating the core `.matiane` folder along with its subdirectories: `.matiane/objects` (for storing versioned content) and `.matiane/refs` (for storing pointers like branches). It also establishes the initial `HEAD` file, pointing it to the default branch reference: `ref: refs/heads/main`.

```bash
./matiane init
```

### `cat-file`

The `cat-file` command's primary purpose is to inspect the contents of an object in the repository database. In a full Git implementation, it supports various modes like displaying the object's type or size, but here, it's used to read and output the content of a stored object (blob, tree, or commit) identified by its SHA-1 hash.


```bash
./matiane cat-file -p <object-sha>
```

*(The implementation expects the object SHA as the third argument, suggesting a format similar to the Git command where the `-p` flag is typically used for "pretty-print".)*

### `hash-object`

The `hash-object` command computes the SHA-1 hash (the object ID) for the contents of a given file. The hash is printed to standard output. Crucially, if the `-w` flag is provided, the command will also compress the file content, wrap it with the appropriate header, and write it into the object database as a **blob object** before printing the hash.


```bash
# Calculate and print hash
./matiane hash-object <file-path>

# Calculate, write to DB, and print hash
./matiane hash-object -w <file-path>
```

### `ls-tree`

The `ls-tree` command lists the entries contained within a **tree object**, which represents a snapshot of a directory. The output typically includes the mode, object type, SHA-1 hash, and name for each file or subdirectory within that tree. You can modify the output using the optional flag. Providing the `--name-only` flag limits the output to display only the names of the entries.


```bash
# List full details of the tree's contents
./matiane ls-tree <tree-sha>

# List only the names of the files/directories
./matiane ls-tree --name-only <tree-sha>
```

### `write-tree`

The `write-tree` command is responsible for creating a **tree object** based on the current state of the working directory. It recursively examines the files and subdirectories, creating nested tree objects as needed. The resulting main tree object is written to the repository database, and its unique SHA-1 hash is output to standard output. This effectively captures a directory snapshot ready to be committed.


```bash
./matiane write-tree
```

### `commit-tree`

The `commit-tree` command creates a new **commit object**. This object points to a specific **tree SHA** (the directory snapshot), links back to its **parent commit SHA** (the previous state in history), and includes a **commit message** along with metadata (assumed to be internally handled). The newly created commit object is stored in the database, and its SHA-1 hash is printed.


```bash
./matiane commit-tree <tree-sha> -p <parent-sha> -m <message>
```

*(Note on argument parsing: The implementation expects a strict positional order: the tree SHA at position 2, the parent SHA at position 4, and the message at position 6.)*
